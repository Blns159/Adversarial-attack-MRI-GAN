# Adversarial Attacks on GANs for Medical Image Synthesis

This project investigates how adversarial data poisoning affects GAN training in the context of medical image generation (MRI). Specifically, we simulate black-box attacks (e.g., tumor injection, Gaussian noise) on GAN training data and evaluate the impact on image quality. Defense strategies such as MedGAN-based inpainting and noise detection are also implemented and assessed.

## Project Description

We explore how adversarial data poisoningâ€”through imperceptible modifications like fake tumor insertion or Gaussian noiseâ€”can degrade the performance of GANs in medical imaging tasks. Our experiments are conducted on axial brain MRI slices using multiple GAN models (DCGAN, LSGAN, WGAN-GP). We simulate attacks on the training data and assess the GANs' output quality under these scenarios. In response, we also experiment with defense mechanisms such as image restoration using MedGAN and attack detection models.
